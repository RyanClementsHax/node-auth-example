# node-auth-example

## Setup

This requires the following entries in your `hosts` file on your operating system
```
127.0.0.1   nodeauth.dev
127.0.0.1   api.nodeauth.dev
```

Install the packages with `yarn install`

### Note to WSL users

I have not for the life of me been able to get `Caddy` or `npx serve ui` to work within `WSL` I'm open to any suggestions on how to get this working, but for now, avoid using it there
